Software: Flash-VideoIO

You are free to use the software in your application 
but if you modify anything you must contribute back the
changes.

Building

Edit the Makefile to point to the correct mxmlc
install the correct Flex SDKs and playerglobal.swc
and run make. You need to have playerglobal in version
sub-directories for versions that you are compiling for.
The default is to compile for 10.0, 10.3 and 11.0.
It used Flex SDK version 3.5 (for 10.0) and 4.5 (for 10.3 
and 11.0).

  $ make

This will create the SWF files in bin-release directory.
Please see the project website and tutorial on how to
use the SWF.

Description

The core VideoIO software is a monolithic ~5k lines of
ActionScript code. A single file helps me manage it 
easily while focussing on the external applications.
