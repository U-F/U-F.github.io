Examples of real applications using the Flash VideoIO project
-------------------------------------------------------------

Please see the brief description of these projects on 
http://code.google.com/p/flash-videoio/

For these applications to work, you need to copy the latest
VideoIO.swf to the following locations.

./public-chat/with-channel-api/static/VideoIO.swf
./public-chat/with-polling/src/static/VideoIO.swf
./random-face/with-channel-api/static/VideoIO.swf
./random-face/with-polling/src/static/VideoIO.swf
./django-apps/static/VideoIO.swf
./face-talk/VideoIO.swf

For the face-talk application, you also need to change the
index.php file: replace XXXX with your APP-ID and YYYY with
your SECRET of your Facebook developer key.
